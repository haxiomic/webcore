- [ ] Gain node
    - Better approach for passing data into the audio thread (LockedValue will not do)
- [ ] Fix iOS web
- [ ] Timelines
    - currentTime, updated each step
    - use sample offset to scnhedule exact sample (that way we don't need 128 sample quanta)
    - mark each node with currentTime when last processed, that way we can detect cycles
    - [ ] start(t, offset)
- [ ] AudioSprite play/pause support
- [ ] end-of-source handling
    - onEnd callback
    - flag that's ready in a haxe main loop
- [ ] Move audio to lib

- [ ] Image via stb_image
- [ ] Asset system
    - [ ] Platform native code
- [ ] App main + platform native code
    - [ ] View resized
    - [ ] App life cycle
    - [ ] Keyboard events
- [ ] Settings files per system
    - [ ] local storage?
    - [ ] iOS settings
    - [ ] Android settings
    - [ ] Desktop to file? Or Windows/mac settings?
- [ ] Less boilerplate per platform -> code generation

- [ ] Switch to dynamic libraries so we can link with system libraries during haxe compile (and not platform compile)
    - [ ] Link with AVFoundation and AudioToolbox when building lib for iOS and OpenSLES for Android
- [ ] Can we include the JNI code inside the main codebase so it's not compiled separately with Android?
- [ ] Explicit path resolution in Assets.hx
