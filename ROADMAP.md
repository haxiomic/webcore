- Can we generate a .framework for iOS?
    https://theswiftdev.com/2018/01/25/deep-dive-into-swift-frameworks/
- And generate an .aar for Android?
    https://medium.com/@yushulx/how-to-build-so-library-files-into-aar-bundle-in-android-studio-a44387c9a012

    => The bundling code should be independent from the AppInterface (so you can make non-graphics bundles)
    => Maybe a macro generates a bash/bat script in the hxcpp output directory that creates the frameworks when executed
    => Users then do `-cmd _hxcpp-bin/generate-lib.sh`

    => A compiler macro could be used to make this easy, so adding something like
        `--macro Tool.generateFramework('com.example.MyFrameworkName')`
        This might also add `-D HAXE_OUTPUT_PART=MinimalGL` and
            ```
            --each
            -D iphoneos
            -D HXCPP_ARM64
            --next
            -D iphonesim
            -D HXCPP_M64
            ```
        Ideally this generate the native platform glue code â€“ C-API and Swift/Java/JNI



! Main loop does not occur on iOS and Android !
    - It's because there is no `main()` and 
        "If `haxe.MainLoop` is kept from DCE, then we will insert an `haxe.EntryPoint.run()` call just at then end of `main()`.
        This class can be redefined by custom frameworks so they can handle their own main loop logic."
! Ensure initialization thread is the same as drawFrame thread on iOS and Android !
! To solve the connection gc issue, maybe we don't make the connection two-way until start() occurs !
That is
{
    var node = audioContext.createNode();
    node.connect(audioContext.destination) // only store connected destination in node, not in destination
    // node.start(), now a two-way link is created
    node = null;
    // node should get collected if used or not
}
