- [ ] volume
    - Don't use a decoder for this, instead we can use a read samples callback in AudioSource, which is used in place of a decoder
    - GainNode â€“> Custom decoder, store nativeAudioSources in userData, call mixSources in onRead and then apply transform
        - transform decoder should be implemented in C, probably?
- AudioSprite play/pause support
- [ ] end-of-source handling
    - onEnd callback
    - flag that's ready in a haxe main loop
- [ ] WebAudio timing system (currentTime and start(t, offset))

- [ ] Fix iOS web
- [ ] Switch to dynamic libraries so we can link with system libraries during haxe compile (and not platform compile)
    - [ ] Link with AVFoundation and AudioToolbox when building lib for iOS and OpenSLES for Android
- [ ] Can we include the JNI code inside the main codebase so it's not compiled separately with Android?
- [ ] Explicit path resolution in Assets.hx
